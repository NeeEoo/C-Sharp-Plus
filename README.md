# C-Sharp-Plus
C-Sharp-Plus (C#+), A project that makes it easier to use c++.

This project makes it so you can use c# functions in c++ without using mscorlib.

## How to use
First download `csp.h` and `csp.cpp`. (will come later)

In your c++ program include `csp.h`. (will come later)

`#include "csp.h"`

Add `using namespace CSP;` to use C-Sharp-Plus functions without typing `CSP::` first.

Then you can use all C-Sharp-Plus functions.

## Some things i still need to do

- [ ] Add more functions
- [ ] Add more overloads
- [ ] Add Linux support
